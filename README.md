# Enigma-Machine
An old project of mine that mimics the behavior of an enigma machine

The original-src folder contains the original project in c++ and might not work at all, but was the base of the single file found in modified-src, which is a simple working adaptation that I made which was made to be easy to get to run on an Arduino.

It is really really really old, so the code might be pretty awful, but I tested it against this simulator: http://enigmaco.de/enigma/enigma_it.html and it seemed to work just fine.
